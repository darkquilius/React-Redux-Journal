# React-Redux-Journal

Deployed: https://darkquilius.github.io/React-Redux-Journal/

This was a day project I made using a Wes Bos tutorial to learn react-redux. I feel like I could use this in a multitude of my future projects. The usage is straight forward but I feel like I should research the set up a little bit more for usage in other platforms besides react.

You can find all of Wes Bos' courses here: https://wesbos.com/courses. I would HIGHLY reccomend them. I have learned alot from them!
